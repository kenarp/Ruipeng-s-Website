# My personal website

This website is a NodeJS based project to show my design portfolio as well as front-end development skills. I use Render.com to deploy this project with my personal domain.

## A simple HLS video server

The NodeJS/Express JS backend server serves HLS video stream, which is used to demonstrate my design in the portfolio page.
