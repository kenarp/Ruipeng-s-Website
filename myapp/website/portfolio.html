        The lost & found project is designed and proposed to be a potential new
        feature for Waze, an app providing real-time driving directions with
        live traffic updates. This feature allows Waze users to report their
        lost and/or found personal items and then mark them on the in-app
        real-time interactive map, which dramatically improves efficiency and
        accuracy compared to the current situation.

          Food waste is a widespread and increasingly urgent global problem.
          According to research in 2011, the Food and Agriculture Organization
          estimates approximately one third of food produced for human
          consumption, is lost or wasted annually. The threat of food waste for
          our sustainable future is increasingly being recognized by many
          countries and organizations. UN targets a 50% reduction in consumer
          food waste and the EU recycling of 60% of all household waste, both by
          2030. In 2015, the U.S. 2030 Food Loss and Waste Reduction goal has
          also been announced. Led by the EPA, USDA and FDA, this is the
          first-ever domestic goal to reduce food loss and waste, which seeks to
          cut food loss and waste in half by the year 2030. We know that
          refrigerator is the major place for food storage at consumers' home.
          However, as a designer, I found it is the place where many foods have
          been wasted simultaneously. Extant refrigerator products are very
          similar to each other: They are visually closed; They are always boxy
          so not easy to check and get food in the dark and deep corners; Their
          rooms and shelves are preset, even though some of them have 'flex
          zone' as advertised, users can not freely adjust it based on their own
          needs. What if we make a new refrigerator with transparent doors so
          users can clearly see what they have inside? What if a refrigerator is
          in cylinder, not boxy anymore, so the user can put in and retrieve
          food easier? What if the whole storage room can be adjusted, not only
          the size but also the temperature for different foods, freely by the
          consumers? Even from a phone? In this project, I'm going to discover
          these possible design opportunities, to better preserve our food for
          tomorrow.

          These photos I took at Venice perfectly reflect where I got
          inspirations for this artwork design. Both the elegant shape of
          Gondola, as well as the classical structure of roof beams in
          traditional buildings, left a strong impression of this famous Italian
          city and its culture. I then realized that these two elements can be
          somehow fused in a way, to be used as an aesthetic reference for
          artwork design. With the help of 3D CAD software, SolidWorks, together
          with my modeling experiences, I finally found a solution to have these
          two elements harmoniously presented in one piece, although the process
          was pretty challenging and time consuming. You can see my effort and
          result from the photos of 3D printed parts below. During this project,
          my skill of 3D modeling has been trained, my understanding of
          aesthetics become deeper, my craftsmanship of sanding and gluing 3D
          printed parts has been improved, and most importantly, as I described
          in the statement of purpose, at the first time I realized that the
          latent power of introducing information technology into traditional
          product design field. From that time I started to think about moving
          into the technology world of Information Science and Human- Computer
          Interaction.
